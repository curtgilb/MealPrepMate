Remove and let the pans cool.\nTo make the marshmallow, pour 1/2 cup of water into the bowl of a stand mixer (remove the beaters for now) and sprinkle the gelatin on top. Allow the gelatin to bloom for 5 minutes.\nWhile the gelatin is blooming, add the remaining 1/2 cup water, honey and salt to a small pot with a candy thermometer.

In the last minute, add the vanilla bean.\nDivide the marshmallow between the two pans on top of the graham cracker and use an offset spatula to flatten the top. Sprinkle with powdered sugar or arrowroot flour and allow to set a minimum of 6 hours or overnight.\nUsing a large knife, press directly down (do not use a saw motion) to slice the s'mores into bite-sized pieces. If the knife sticks, add more powdered sugar or arrowroot flour. Place the smore's bites on a large piece of parchment paper on a sheet pan.\nHeat the dark chocolate chips in a double boiler over medium heat, until just melted.

        "instructions": "Place all crepe ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, mix together for one minute. The consistency should be that of a very thin batter. If it's too thick, add more water.\nCover your batter and refrigerate for 30 minutes, to let the bubbles settle.\nHeat a crepe pan over medium heat. Once hot, lift the pan up, scoop 1/4 cup of the batter into the center of the pan and quickly swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Place back on the heat and cook for 1-2 minutes. Once the top looks dry, flip it over and cook an additional 30-45 seconds.\nPlace the cooked crepe on a paper towel to cool and repeat this process until all crepes are made. Once fully cooled, store the crepes in an airtight container/ziploc with a paper towel until ready to assemble the cake.\nTo make the buttercream, combine the egg whites, maple syrup and cream of tartar in a heatproof bowl. Make a double boiler by placing this bowl on top of a pot of simmering water (ensuring the water doesn't touch the bottom of the top bowl). Whisk the mixture constantly for 4-5 minutes, or until a candy thermometer reaches 160 degrees fahrenheit.\nPour the mixture into the bowl of stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Start by whipping on low, then gradually increase the speed to high as the mixture thickens. Whip for several minutes, until stiff peaks have formed and let cool. (*tip - make sure the meringue is fully cooled. Any heat will instantly melt the shortening or butter and make it too runny).\nTurn the mixer back on medium-high speed and add the shortening slowly, in 1 tablespoon increments. It's normal for the meringue to deflate, but it should thicken up. If not, see the tips mentioned above. Continue mixing and add the coconut cream and amaretto, until flavored to your liking, then add the shredded coconut until fully combined.\nTo assemble the cake, spread a thin layer of the buttercream on a crepe. Keep the layers thin and flat. Add a crepe and repeat.\nTo make the coconut whipped cream, scoop out the solidified coconut cream from the top of the can (leaving the water behind) and place in a bowl. Add the vanilla and honey and beat with a hand mixer for 10-20 seconds.\nScoop the coconut whipped cream on top of the cake and sprinkle with almonds.",

Simmer the chicken breast for 15 minutes or until done.\nRemove the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for a minute.\nAdd the carrots, celery and onion to the pot and cook uncovered on medium heat for 3-4 minutes.

Then add the shredded chicken and stir.\nDivide the pie filling between four 7-ounce ramekins.\nRemove the dough from the freezer and slice the ball into quarters with a knife. Roll each quarter into a new ball. Use a tortilla press to flatten the individual ball between two pieces of parchment paper or roll the ball out. Remove the top piece of parchment paper and flip the dough circle on top of a ramekin. Remove the other piece of parchment paper and gently press down on the sides to seal the top. Remove any excess dough.\nMake the egg wash by whisking together the egg and water.

Remove the flesh of the sweet potato and process through a potato ricer. Alternatively, you could mash the sweet potato, but make sure it's mashed well to prevent lumps. Once riced or mashed, let cool for 10 minutes.\nIn a large bowl or on a floured work surface, add 3/4 of the flour mixture to the sweet potato and create a well in the middle. Add the egg and lightly beat it, bring in the flour and potato until a thick paste forms. Then, use your hands to continue combining. If the sweet potato is too sticky, add more flour as needed until you can form a log with the dough.\nSlice the dough into equal sections. Roll each of those sections into a 1-inch rope. Cut each rope into 1-inch pieces and set aside.\nOnce all the dough has been cut, use a gnocchi paddle or fork to create indentations in the gnocchi.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi in batches to the pot and cook for 2-3 minutes, letting the gnocchi float to the surface.

A high-powered blender makes the filling creamy and fine (which is my recommendation), but you can also use your food processor. Blend for a minute or two, until thick and creamy.\nPour your filling on top of the crust. Shake the pan gently to remove any air bubbles. Then, place your pan in the freezer for 30 minutes.\nWhile your cheesecake is hardening in the freezer, you can make your topping. Place all of the topping ingredients in your food processor (after you've cleaned it), and pulse it for 30 seconds. Then set aside until your cheesecake has hardened.\nAfter 30 minutes, your cheesecake should have hardened enough to place the topping. Gently spoon the berry mixture on top and place back in the freezer.

At first the dough will be wet and sticky, but as the cassava flour absorbs the water it will become dryer and more pliable. The texture should be similar to soft Play-Doh. If it's too sticky, add a bit more cassava flour. And if it's too dry, add a bit more water.\nWhen you have a mound of dough, roll it into a log shape in the bowl (like a tube of cookie dough). Then, slice it into 6 pieces. Take each piece and roll into a ball.\nIf you have a tortilla press, take each ball of dough, place it between two pieces of parchment paper and press into a flat tortilla (this method is much easier). Without a tortilla press, take each ball of dough between two pieces of parchment paper and roll out into an approximate 6-inch circle.\nHeat a non-stick pan or flat griddle on medium-high heat. As the dry pan heats up, place one tortilla in the pan and cook for approximately one minute. Flip the tortilla and cook the other side for an additional minute. Continue cooking all tortillas and transfer to a plate with a paper towel.\nEat immediately or freeze in batches for future use.",

You may need to put something heavy on them to keep them under water.\nAdd the maple syrup, tamari, lemon juice, garlic and ginger to a small pot on high heat. Bring the sauce to a boil and then turn it down to low, stirring occasionally. Cook for about 10 minutes or until the sauce has reduced in half and becomes thicker, then remove from the heat.\nTurn the grill on medium high until it reaches 350°F (175°C).

Cover dish and marinate chicken in the fridge for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.\nCook the Chicken and Rice\nSear Chicken\nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. In a large ovenproof skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil on medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs skin-side down and cook until skin is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Reserve the leftover marinade as you'll add that back in later.\nFlip the chicken and cook another 5 minutes. Remove chicken thighs from skillet and set aside.\nClean Pan\nUse your tongs to scrape and remove any browned bits, and bunch up a couple of paper towels to soak up some fat from the pan, but not all. Reserve a little bit of grease to cook the onions.\nSaute\nAdd the diced onions and stir for 1-2 minutes, or until they start to become translucent.\nAdd the chopped spinach, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, and reserved marinade. Stir for another 30 seconds or until the spinach starts to wilt.\nAdd the rice to the skillet, and stir well to coat the rice with the oil.\nPour the chicken stock into the skillet and stir well. Bring this to a simmer on the stove.\nBake\nArrange chicken thighs on top of the rice, then cover the skillet and place in the preheated oven. Bake for 35 minutes. Remove the lid, return the skillet to the oven, and bake until chicken is cooked through and rice is tender, about 10 minutes more.\nRest\nLet the chicken and rice rest for 5 to 10 minutes. The rice will look really dark as the spinach and onions rise to the surface. Just fluff the rice up with a fork to mix everything back together before serving.\nServe\nTop with chopped parsley and grilled lemon slices or fresh lemon zest.",

Cover completely with water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 15 minutes, until the chilies have softened.\nRoast the veggies. While the chilies are simmering, add the tomatoes, onion, and garlic cloves to a quarter sheet pan. Broil them for 4 to 6 minutes, until lightly charred.\nMake the sauce. Transfer the chilies and 1 cup of the remaining water to a high-powered blender. Remove the garlic from it's peel and add it to the blender along with the tomatoes, onion, broth, vinegar, cumin, oregano, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger. Blend on high for 1 to 2 minutes, until completely smooth.\nSlow cook the birria. Place the beef chunks in the slow cooker. Pour the birria sauce on top, and add the bay leaves. Use tongs to gently mix it all together. then cover. Cook on low for 8 to 9 hours, or on high for 4 to 5 hours. The beef should be tender and fall apart easily when shredded with a fork. If it doesn't shred easily, cook it a bit longer.\nShred the meat and combine it with the sauce. Discard the bay leaves. Remove the beef to a cutting board and use two forks to shred it. Place the shredded beef back in the slow cooker, stir it, and let it absorb the liquid (aka consommé).\nTo Make Birria Tacos\nDip the tortillas. Dip the tortillas in the birria liquid (consomme). The top layer of the consomme has more fat, which is perfect for frying.\nFry. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the wet tortilla, and cook on one side until lightly crispy, then flip over with tongs. Top with a sprinkle of cheese across the whole tortilla. Add a portion of birria on half the tortilla, along with a sprinkle of onion and cilantro.

While the eggs are boiling, bring a separate medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the potatoes, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the potatoes (leaving the hot water in the pot), transfer them to a cutting board, and let them cool. Then slice in half.\nBlanch beans\nBlanch the beans. Add the green beans to the pot and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, until they turn bright green. Then chill in an ice water bath and drain the beans in a colander.\nAssemble salad\nAssemble the Nicoise salad. Spread the salad greens out onto a large platter. Arrange the potatoes, green beans, tuna, tomatoes, olives, red onion, and soft-boiled eggs on top. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Drizzle the lemon vinaigrette over the salad. I use about half the vinaigrette and save the remainder in the fridge for future use.",

Use your hands, an ice cream scoop or falafel scoop to form the falafel into balls or patties. If you find the mixture is too wet, you can add another tablespoon of chickpea flour. If it's too dry and crumbly, you can add a teaspoon or two of water or lemon juice.\nCook the falafel. Once the falafel are formed, you can cook them by your preferred method mentioned above. To deep fry the falafel, add about 3 inches of oil to a pot on medium heat. Heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). Cook the falafel in batches (about 6 to 8 at a time) for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden.\nRemove the falafel. Use a skimmer to check the color of the falafel and make sure they don't overcook. Then remove them to a paper towel-lined plate.\nServe the falafel immediately, while warm and crispy on the outside. They're delicious served with tahini sauce as well.",

Once the butternut squash is cool enough to handle, use a large spoon to scoop out the flesh and transfer it to a high-powered blender.

Then fill it with the onion, lemon, and fresh herbs. If your turkey is smaller, don't overfill the cavity as you do want some airflow.\nStir\nIn a small bowl, make the herb butter by stirring the softened butter, garlic, salt, pepper, rosemary and thyme together.\nRub\nLoosen the skin of the turkey gently by sliding your fingers underneath. Then rub about 1/3 of the herb butter between the skin and turkey breasts.\nRub the remaining herb butter all over the entire outside of the turkey.\nSet\nPlace the turkey on a roasting rack or on top of a bed of vegetables (if you don't have a rack), or both! Tuck the wing tips under the turkey to prevent them from burning.\nRoast\nPlace the turkey in the oven and roast for about 15 minutes per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches 158°-160°F. You don't need to baste the turkey, but do keep an eye on it after it's about 75% done. If you notice the skin browning too quickly, you can place aluminum foil on top. To verify the temperature, place a thermometer into the meatiest part of the thigh or breast. The turkey will continue to cook once it's removed from the oven and will rise in temperature to 165°F, after it's rested.\nRest\nLet the turkey to rest for 30 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute, making for a deliciously juicy turkey. To keep the turkey warm, you can cover the turkey with aluminum foil on the counter.\nCarve and serve the turkey.

Once it's browned, remove it with a slotted spoon and place it in the casserole pan.\nDrain and Saute\nCook the veggies. Drain off all but a tablespoon of grease from the pan, then saute the onion and bell pepper for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and saute for another minute. Transfer this mixture to the casserole pan.\nAdd\nMix everything together. Remove the sweet potato from the oven and add it to the casserole pan along with the crumbled bacon, breakfast sausage, onion, and bell pepper.

My personal favorite is removing the steaks from the oven at 120°F for medium rare.\nRest\nRemove the cooked filet mignon steaks to a plate, cover them with aluminum foil, and let them rest for 5 to 7 minutes before serving.

In a small bowl, mix together the butter, garlic, salt, thyme, rosemary, and black pepper.\nPat and Rub\nAfter the prime rib has come to room temperature, pat it down with paper towels to make sure it's dry. Then rub the entire outside of the prime rib with the herb butter mixture.\nPlace the prime rib in an oven-safe pan or roasting tray with the bone-side down, fat-side up. Place the onion slices in the pan around the meat, if you're making the red wine au jus. If not, you can omit the onions.\nCook the prime rib in the center of the oven for 20 minutes at 450°F (230°C). It should get a nice sear on the outside. If not, cook it a few minutes longer. Then reduce the temperature of the oven to 325°F (160°C) and continue cooking until the internal temperature reaches 120°F (50°C), which takes about an hour and a half, for medium-rare. But go by temperature, not time, as it will depend on the size of your prime rib and your oven.\nRemove and Slice\nRemove the prime rib from the oven and let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes. You can tent it with aluminum foil to keep it warm. Then, remove the string and bones, and slice it up into thick ½-inch thick slices.\nRed Wine Au Jus\nAdd\nAfter you've removed the fat from the pan, add up to ¼ cup of drippings back in along with the beef broth and red wine. If you have leftover herbs, you can toss those in as well.\nSimmer and Drizzle\nSimmer this for about 15 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half. It's meant to be a thin sauce, but if you'd like to add a little bit of a thickener, you can do that as well. Strain the au jus to remove the onion and any browned bits, then drizzle over the prime rib.",

Take care not to let the milk boil.\nPeel Bananas\nWhile the coconut milk is heating, peel and slice 3 bananas into 1/2-inch thick rounds. Set aside.\nOnce the coconut milk is steaming, remove the saucepan from the heat, add the sliced bananas, and stir with a spatula to coat them with the coconut milk.\nInfuse Milk\nCover the saucepan and let it sit at room temperature for 4 hours to infuse the milk with banana flavor.\nOptional Overnight\nTo finish the pudding now, proceed to the next step. For a more intense banana flavor, transfer the banana and milk mixture to a glass bowl or dish, cover, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours\nMake the Pudding\nStrain Milk\nRemove the banana pieces from the milk using a slotted spoon or skimmer. You will not need the strained banana pieces for the rest of this recipe but you can save them for smoothies or other baking recipes.\nWhisk Ingredients\nPour 1/2 cup of the infused banana milk into a mixing bowl, then add the honey, egg yolks, salt, and arrowroot powder. Whisk together.\nHeat Milk\nIn a medium saucepan, reheat the remaining milk over medium heat, stirring gently until simmering.\nTemper the Egg Mixture\nVery slowly (just a few tablespoons at a time) drizzle about half of the hot milk into the egg mixture while whisking rapidly to keep the milk from curdling the eggs.\nThicken Pudding\nReturn the saucepan to the stovetop, pour the tempered egg mixture into to saucepan, and warm over low heat, stirring constantly until the pudding mixture simmers and thickens slightly, about 3-4 minutes. Watch carefully to make sure the pudding mixture does not boil or over-thicken.\nStir in Vanilla\nRemove the hot pudding from the heat, and stir in the remaining one teaspoon of vanilla.\nStrain Pudding\nPour the pudding through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl, to remove any clumps from the pudding.\nCover Pudding\nCool slightly, then cover by pressing a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding. This is optional, but it helps to prevent a skin from forming on the pudding.\nChill Pudding in Fridge\nChill the pudding in the fridge for at least 3-4 hours, or until it's firmed up slightly.\nServe\nTo serve, top the banana pudding with sliced bananas, coconut whipped cream, and toasted coconut flakes.",
