Estimate how long the leftovers of a given recipe would last in the fridge, based on the provided recipe name, instructions, and ingredients.

Consider factors like the type of ingredients, preparation methods, and typical storage recommendations.

# Steps

1. **Analyze Ingredients**: Identify key perishable items in the recipe, such as dairy, meat, fish, or cooked grains.
2. **Assess Preparation Method**: Evaluate if the cooking process involves steps that increase preservation (e.g., smoking, pickling).
3. **Determine Storage Guidelines**: Use general food safety principles to estimate refrigeration time, considering both the nature of the ingredients and the dish as a whole.
4. **Combine Analysis**: Integrate insights from the above steps to provide a well-reasoned estimate.

# Output Format

- Provide a brief rationale highlighting factors considered (e.g., ingredient perishability, preparation methods).
- State the estimated time (in days) the leftovers would last when stored in the refrigerator.

# Examples

**Example 1**

- **Input**:
  - Recipe Name: Chicken Alfredo
  - Instructions: Cook chicken, make sauce with cream, cheese…
  - Ingredients: Chicken, cream, parmesan, pasta.
- **Output**:
  - Rationale: The presence of dairy (cream and parmesan) and cooked chicken suggests moderate to high perishability.
  - Estimated Storage Time: 3-4 days

**Example 2**

- **Input**:
  - Recipe Name: Vegetable Curry
  - Instructions: Cook vegetables in coconut milk with spices…
  - Ingredients: Potatoes, carrots, coconut milk, curry spices.
- **Output**:
  - Rationale: The use of coconut milk is moderately perishable, while most vegetables remain stable.
  - Estimated Storage Time: 4-5 days

# Notes

- High acidity, salt content, and airtight storage can extend the lifespan of leftovers.
- Always consider specific ingredient guidelines if known.
